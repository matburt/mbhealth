# PWA Push Notifications Integration Plan

## Current State
The MB Health app already has a comprehensive notification system using Apprise for 100+ services. The PWA implementation adds the capability for native web push notifications.

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Web Push Foundation
1. **Service Worker Enhancement**
   - Add push event listener to existing service worker
   - Handle notification display and click actions
   - Implement notification permission request flow

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Add push notification subscription management UI
   - Integrate with existing NotificationSettings component
   - Add web push as a new notification channel type

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Extend existing notification system to support web push
   - Add web push subscription storage (endpoint, keys)
   - Add web push as new Apprise-compatible service

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
1. **Permission Management**
   - Smart permission request timing (after login, on first notification setup)
   - Graceful fallback to existing notification channels
   - Clear opt-in/opt-out controls

2. **Notification Content**
   - Rich notifications with actions (View, Dismiss, Snooze)
   - Leverage existing notification templates and content
   - Include relevant health data context

3. **Offline Support**
   - Queue notifications when offline
   - Display cached notifications
   - Sync notification status when reconnected

### Implementation Files

#### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// src/services/pushNotifications.ts - New service
// src/components/PushNotificationSetup.tsx - New component  
// src/components/NotificationSettings.tsx - Enhanced with web push
// public/sw.js - Enhanced service worker (via Workbox)
```

#### Backend Changes
```python
# app/services/web_push_service.py - New service
# app/models/notification.py - Add web push subscription model
# app/api/api_v1/endpoints/notifications.py - Add web push endpoints
```

### Technical Requirements

1. **VAPID Keys Setup**
   - Generate public/private key pair for web push
   - Store securely in environment variables
   - Configure in both frontend and backend

2. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE web_push_subscriptions (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
       endpoint TEXT NOT NULL,
       p256dh_key TEXT NOT NULL,
       auth_key TEXT NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
       last_used_at TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

3. **Security Considerations**
   - HTTPS required for web push (already implemented)
   - Secure key storage and transmission
   - User consent and preference management
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Benefits of Integration

1. **Unified Notification Experience**
   - All notifications (email, Discord, SMS, web push) managed in one place
   - Consistent notification preferences and scheduling
   - Leverages existing notification templates and logic

2. **Enhanced PWA Experience**
   - Native mobile app-like notifications
   - Works even when app is not open
   - Increased user engagement and retention

3. **Minimal Development Effort**
   - Builds on existing notification infrastructure
   - Uses proven Apprise framework
   - Reuses existing UI components and patterns

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks (basic web push functionality)
- **Phase 2**: 1 week (enhanced UX and offline support)
- **Testing & Refinement**: 1 week

## Priority Assessment
**Medium Priority** - Enhances user experience but not critical for core PWA functionality. The PWA is fully functional without push notifications, and the existing notification system already provides comprehensive coverage for user alerts.

## Recommendation
Implement this enhancement after validating PWA adoption and user engagement metrics. Focus on core health tracking features first, then add push notifications based on user feedback and usage patterns.
